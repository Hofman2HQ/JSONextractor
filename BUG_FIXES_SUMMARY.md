## Result

The JSON Reader application is now much more robust and handles edge cases gracefully. All critical bugs have been fixed, and the application should no longer crash due to unhandled errors. The code is more maintainable and provides better user experience with proper error messages and fallbacks. 

## Additional Improvements

### 1. **Primary Result Left Empty** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The "Primary Result" field was not being extracted from the JSON data.

**Root Cause**: The field names in the `findNestedValue` function didn't match the actual JSON structure. The function was looking for `primaryResult` and `PrimaryResult` but the actual field was `PrimaryProcessingResult`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the field search order in `extractor.js` to prioritize `PrimaryProcessingResult` first
- Added proper field name matching for DocumentStatusReport2 structure
- Enhanced the primary result processing to show both code and description

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
const primaryResult = findNestedValue(data, [
  'primaryResult', 
  'PrimaryResult',
  'DocumentStatusReport2.PrimaryProcessingResult'
]);

// After
let primaryResult = null;
dsr2List.forEach((dsr2, idx) => {
  if (primaryResult === null && dsr2.PrimaryProcessingResult !== undefined) {
    primaryResult = dsr2.PrimaryProcessingResult;
    primaryResultPath = `DocumentStatusReport2${idx > 0 ? `[${idx}]` : ''}.PrimaryProcessingResult`;
  }
});
```

**Result**: Now properly extracts and displays primary results with both code and description (e.g., "20 - The request is conditional")

### 2. **Processing Remarks Categorization** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Some processing remarks were still showing as "Other" category.

**Root Cause**: The categorization logic in ResultsDisplay didn't match the updated categories from the official DocumentStatusReport2 documentation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the categorization logic to use specific code arrays that match the official documentation
- Added comprehensive mapping for all processing remark codes
- Enhanced the display to show proper categories (Authentication, Document Quality, etc.)

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Updated categorization logic with specific code arrays
if ([0, 20, 40, 50, 55, 60, 80].includes(code)) return 'Authentication';
if ([100, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124].includes(code)) return 'Document Quality';
// ... and so on for all categories
```

**Result**: All processing remarks are now properly categorized and displayed with correct descriptions.

### 3. **Risk Management Remarks Not Parsed** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Risk Management Remarks weren't being parsed at all.

**Root Cause**: The field names and extraction logic didn't match the actual JSON structure in RiskManagementReport.EffectiveConclusion.Reasons.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive extraction logic for RiskManagementReport structure
- Enhanced the search to look in both top-level and page-level RiskManagementReport objects
- Added proper mapping for all risk management remark codes

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Enhanced risk management extraction
if (resultData.RiskManagementReport && resultData.RiskManagementReport.EffectiveConclusion) {
  const eff = resultData.RiskManagementReport.EffectiveConclusion;
  if (eff.Reasons) {
    if (Array.isArray(eff.Reasons.RiskManagementRemarks)) 
      riskRemarksList = riskRemarksList.concat(eff.Reasons.RiskManagementRemarks);
  }
}
```

**Result**: Risk management remarks are now properly extracted and displayed (e.g., "18 - Face comparison result returned irregular status")

### 4. **Metadata Not Showing All Details** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The metadata section wasn't showing all the extracted document data.

**Root Cause**: The metadata extraction was limited and didn't include DocumentData2 fields.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced metadata extraction to include all DocumentData2 fields
- Added comprehensive field extraction with proper value handling
- Improved the display to show all extracted document data in a table format

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Enhanced DocumentData2 extraction
if (docData2 && typeof docData2 === 'object') {
  metadata.documentData2Fields = {};
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(docData2)) {
    if (value && typeof value === 'object' && 'Value' in value) {
      metadata.documentData2Fields[key] = value.Value;
    } else if (value && typeof value === 'object' && 'RawData' in value && value.RawData && 'Value' in value.RawData) {
      metadata.documentData2Fields[key] = value.RawData.Value;
    } else {
      metadata.documentData2Fields[key] = value;
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: Metadata now shows all extracted document data including names, addresses, dates, and other fields.

### 5. **Data Processing Issue in API Flow** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The "Get from API" flow was processing data twice, causing the second processing to fail.

**Root Cause**: GetRequestForm was processing the data and passing the processed result to App.js, which then tried to process it again. The processed data doesn't have the original structure.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed the `processJsonData` call from GetRequestForm.js
- Changed the data flow to pass original JSON data to App.js
- Ensured consistent processing between "Upload File" and "Get from API" flows

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before (in GetRequestForm.js)
const processed = processJsonData(data);
if (onDataReceived) onDataReceived(processed);

// After (in GetRequestForm.js)
if (onDataReceived) onDataReceived(data); // Pass original data
```

**Result**: Both "Upload File" and "Get from API" flows now work consistently and show the same results.

### 6. **Webpack Configuration Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Webpack build was failing due to ES module compatibility issues.

**Root Cause**: The webpack config was mixing CommonJS (`require`) and ES module syntax.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `require.resolve("path-browserify")` and replaced with `"path": false`
- Fixed ES module compatibility issues
- Removed deprecated FileUploader component from build output

**Result**: Clean builds now work without errors.

## Technical Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Data Extraction**
- Added robust recursive search for nested objects
- Implemented comprehensive field mapping for all DocumentStatusReport2 codes
- Added fallback mechanisms for different JSON structures

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- Added defensive checks throughout the codebase
- Enhanced error messages and logging
- Added graceful fallbacks for missing or malformed data

### 3. **Better Debugging**
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Enhanced console output for troubleshooting
- Improved error tracking and reporting

### 4. **Code Quality**
- Removed deprecated components (FileUploader.js)
- Cleaned up build output
- Improved code organization and structure

## Testing Results

## [2024-06-10] UI and Extraction Consistency Improvements

### 1. **Risk Manager's Remarks Path Display**
- **Problem:** The Risk Manager's remarks path in the UI was not always clear or specific to each remark's array position.
- **Fix:** Each risk remark now displays its own full JSON path, including the array index, in the tooltip. This makes it easier to trace the exact source of each remark in the JSON structure.

### 2. **Open/Close All Buttons Alignment**
- **Problem:** The 'Open all' and 'Close all' buttons for remarks were not perfectly aligned with the section title, affecting the UI's aesthetics.
- **Fix:** The layout was updated so that the title and all control buttons are now in a single, visually aligned row, improving the overall look and feel.

### 3. **Single-Source Extraction for Remarks**
- **Problem:** Processing and Risk Manager remarks were sometimes aggregated from multiple locations (e.g., all DSR2s) if remark 140 was present, leading to inconsistent or duplicated results.
- **Fix:** The extraction logic was refactored so that both processing and risk manager remarks are always taken from a single, consistent location (the main node and its new structure locations), regardless of the presence of remark 140. This ensures clarity and consistency in the displayed results.
