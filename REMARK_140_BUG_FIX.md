# Remark 140 Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When remark 140 ("The pages of the multi-page document do not match") was present in the JSON data, no metadata extraction was occurring. This was preventing DocumentData2 fields from being extracted and displayed in the UI.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by early return statements in the `processJsonData` function that prevented the code from reaching the DocumentData2 extraction logic when remark 140 was present:

1. **Workflow JSON early return** (line 436): The function would return early after processing workflow-specific data, preventing access to the remark 140 DocumentData2 extraction logic.

2. **Secure me JSON early return** (line 520): The function would return early after processing Secure me data when DocumentStatusReport2 was present, preventing access to the remark 140 DocumentData2 extraction logic.

3. **Incomplete remark 140 detection**: The fallback section relied on `processingRemarksList.includes(140)`, but this list might not be complete if the code returned early from the workflow or Secure me sections.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Remark 140 Detection
Created a `hasRemark140` function that checks for remark 140 in all possible locations:
- `DocumentStatusReport2.ProcessingResultRemarks`
- `RiskManagementReport.EffectiveConclusion.Reasons.ProcessingResultRemarks`
- Root-level `ProcessingResultRemarks`
- `PageAsSeparateDocumentProcessingReports` (each page's processing remarks)

### 2. Modified Early Return Logic
Updated both early return conditions to check for remark 140 before returning:

**Workflow section:**
```javascript
// Check if remark 140 is present - if so, don't return early to allow DocumentData2 extraction
if (!hasRemark140(resultData)) {
  return processed;
}
```

**Secure me section:**
```javascript
// Check if remark 140 is present - if so, don't return early to allow DocumentData2 extraction
if ((resultData.DocumentStatusReport2 || processedRiskManagement || processedDocTypeDesc) && !hasRemark140(resultData)) {
  return processed;
}
```

### 3. Updated Fallback Logic
Modified the fallback DocumentData2 extraction logic to use the comprehensive `hasRemark140` function instead of relying on `processingRemarksList`:

```javascript
// If remark 140 is present and multi-page structure exists, use advanced logic
if (hasRemark140(resultData) && Array.isArray(resultData.PageAsSeparateDocumentProcessingReports) && resultData.PageAsSeparateDocumentProcessingReports.length >= 2) {
  // Advanced multi-page DocumentData2 extraction logic
}
```

## Code Changes Made

### File: `src/logic/extractor.js`

1. **Added comprehensive `hasRemark140` function** (lines 257-285):
   - Checks all possible locations for remark 140
   - Handles different JSON structures (workflow, Secure me, etc.)
   - Returns true if remark 140 is found anywhere in the data

2. **Modified workflow early return** (lines 464-466):
   - Added remark 140 check before returning
   - Allows processing to continue to DocumentData2 extraction when remark 140 is present

3. **Modified Secure me early return** (lines 559-561):
   - Added remark 140 check before returning
   - Allows processing to continue to DocumentData2 extraction when remark 140 is present

4. **Updated fallback DocumentData2 extraction** (line 687):
   - Changed from `processingRemarksList.includes(140)` to `hasRemark140(resultData)`
   - Ensures consistent remark 140 detection across all code paths

## Testing Results

✅ **Remark 140 Detection**: The comprehensive detection function correctly identifies remark 140 in all possible locations.

✅ **Multi-page Structure Detection**: The code correctly identifies when multi-page document processing reports are present.

✅ **DocumentData2 Extraction**: When both remark 140 and multi-page structure are present, the advanced DocumentData2 extraction logic is triggered.

## Impact

- **Fixed**: Metadata extraction now works correctly when remark 140 is present
- **Improved**: More robust remark 140 detection across different JSON structures
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality remains intact for cases without remark 140

## Files Modified
- `src/logic/extractor.js` - Main bug fix implementation

## Testing
The fix was verified using a test case with remark 140 and multi-page structure, confirming that:
1. Remark 140 is correctly detected
2. Multi-page structure is correctly identified
3. DocumentData2 extraction logic is triggered appropriately
