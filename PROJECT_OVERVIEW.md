# JSON Data Extractor (JSON Reader)

## Overview

**JSON Data Extractor** (also called "JSON Reader") is a web application for uploading, processing, and analyzing JSON files containing document processing results, or for fetching such data from an API using an access token and request ID.

## Main Features

- **File Upload**: Upload a JSON file with document processing results. The app parses and displays key fields in a user-friendly format.
- **API Request**: Enter an access token and request ID to fetch document processing results from an external API. The app validates the token, determines the endpoint, and retrieves the data.
- **Data Extraction & Display**: Extracts and categorizes primary results, processing remarks, risk management remarks, and metadata. Displays results with tooltips and documentation for remark codes.
- **Field Selection**: After parsing, users can select which fields to display from the extracted data.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation for processing and risk management remark codes, now grouped by category for easier navigation.
- **Workflow JSON Support**: Automatically detects and extracts from Workflow JSONs (path: verificationResults.idv.payload.ProcessingReport) as well as Secure me JSONs.
- **JSON Type Display**: The app automatically detects and displays the type of JSON (Workflow or Secure me) in the Metadata section for every upload or API call.

## Technical Overview

- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap, and custom CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express serves the frontend and provides API endpoints for file processing and API proxying.
- **Token & Endpoint Utilities**: Parses JWT tokens, determines API type/region/environment, and constructs API endpoints.
- **Data Processing Logic**: 
  - Robust extraction logic for all fields (summary, remarks, metadata) from both flat and nested JSON structures (root, DocumentStatusReport2, resultData, ProcessingResult, etc.).
  - Aggregates and deduplicates remarks from all plausible locations.
  - Advanced DocumentData2 comparison logic for remark 140 (split-page), with fallback to simpler extraction if not present.
  - Compatible with both legacy and new JSONs.
  - JSON paths and sources for all extracted fields are displayed in the UI for transparency.

## Typical Use Cases

- View and analyze document verification results exported as JSON.
- Fetch and review document processing results from a remote API using secure tokens.
- Understand the meaning of processing and risk management codes from document verification systems.

## Example Workflow

1. Upload a JSON file or enter an access token and request ID.
2. The app parses and processes the data, extracting key results and remarks from all possible locations.
3. Select which fields to display and view documentation for any remark codes.
4. Results and metadata are presented in a clear, categorized format, with JSON paths and sources shown for each field.

## Recent Changes & Bug Fixes

- **Robust Extraction Logic:**
  - Now supports both flat and nested JSON structures for all fields (summary, remarks, metadata).
  - Aggregates and deduplicates remarks from all plausible locations (root, nested, DocumentStatusReport2, etc.).
  - Advanced DocumentData2 comparison logic for remark 140 (split-page), with fallback to simpler extraction if not present.
  - Improved compatibility with legacy and new JSONs.
- **UI Improvements:**
  - JSON paths and sources are now displayed for all extracted fields, making it clear where each value was found.
  - Risk Management Remarks documentation is now grouped by category for easier navigation and completeness.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Improved error handling and fallback logic for missing or malformed data.
  - More descriptive error messages and user feedback.
- **Testing:**
  - All main flows tested for null/undefined, empty, valid, and malformed data.
  - Consistent results for both file upload and API flows.
- **Workflow JSON Support:**
  - The app now detects and fully supports Workflow JSONs, extracting data from verificationResults.idv.payload.ProcessingReport and processing it identically to Secure me JSONs.
- **JSON Type Display:**
  - The type of JSON (Workflow or Secure me) is now automatically detected and shown in the Metadata section of the results, for both file uploads and API calls.

## Known issues (short list)

The repository was reviewed automatically and a short list of issues that may affect stability or developer experience was identified:

- Leftover debug logging: several `console.log` calls remain in source files (`src/App.js`, `src/components/GetRequestForm.js`, `src/components/ResultsDisplay.js`, and built files in `public/`). Remove or gate them behind a debug flag for production builds.
- Undefined variable in UI: `ResultsDisplay.js` references `dataSourceMap` inside the DocumentData2 table but `dataSourceMap` is not defined or imported in that file â€” this will throw at runtime when metadata contains `documentData2DataSource` values.
- Missing favicon: the browser requests `/favicon.ico` and currently returns 404; add a `favicon.ico` to `public/` or reference an existing icon in `public/index.html`.
- Debug code in bundled assets: `public/bundle.js` and `public/dist/bundle.js` contain debug `console.log` statements which should be removed (or rebuilt without them) before production deployment.
- Large bundle warnings: production build warns about large bundle sizes. Consider code-splitting and removing large dependencies to reduce bundle size.

Action items (suggested priority):

1. Fix runtime bug: define or import `dataSourceMap` in `src/components/ResultsDisplay.js` or change the table to not depend on it.
2. Remove or conditionalize `console.log` debug statements in source files; rebuild bundles and verify `public/dist` is updated.
3. Add `public/favicon.ico` and a `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />` in `public/index.html`.
4. Audit `public/` for committed build artifacts (bundles, maps). Prefer keeping only source and building during CI; if keeping bundles is intentional, ensure they are up-to-date with source.
5. Address bundle-size warnings with code-splitting or dependency review.

If you want, I can fix the `dataSourceMap` reference and remove a small number of debug logs as a follow-up change.
